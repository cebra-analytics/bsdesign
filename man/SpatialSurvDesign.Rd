\arguments{
\item{context}{A \code{Context} or inherited class object representing the
context of a bio-security surveillance and area freedom design.}

\item{divisions}{A \code{Divisions} or inherited class object representing
spatial locations (grid-cells or sub-regions/patches) for the surveillance
design.}

\item{establish_pr}{A vector of (relative) probability values to represent
the likelihood of pest establishment at each spatial location specified
by \code{divisions}. Values are assumed to be relative when their
maximum is greater than 1, or an attribute \code{relative = TRUE} is
attached to the parameter.}

\item{lambda}{A vector of efficacy or detection rates for each spatial
location specified by \code{divisions}, such that the probability of
detecting an incursion when present at a part can be expressed via
\code{pr(detect|presence) = 1 - exp(-lambda*allocation)},
for a given allocation of surveillance resources.}

\item{prevalence}{The cell-level design prevalence indicating the minimum
number of location cells that are expected to be infected with the
invasive species if the region of interest specified by \code{divisions}
is infected. Default is \code{1}. Higher values can be used as a proxy
to population growth over time.}

\item{optimal}{The strategy used for finding an effective surveillance
resource allocation. One of (minimum) \code{"cost"}, (maximum)
\code{"saving"} (or cost-dependent benefit), (maximum) \code{"benefit"}
(independent of surveillance costs), or (maximum) \code{"detection"}
sensitivity, or \code{"none"} for representing existing
surveillance designs only.}

\item{mgmt_cost}{A list of vectors to represent estimated management costs
for when the incursion is detected and undetected. Each vector specifies
these costs at each spatial location specified by \code{divisions}. List
elements should be named \code{detected} and \code{undetected}. Default is
an empty list. Units should be consistent with the \code{cost_unit}
parameter specified in the \code{context}.}

\item{benefit}{A vector of values quantifying the benefit (or cost-based
saving) associated with detection at each spatial location specified by
\code{divisions}. Default is \code{NULL}. When the benefit refers to
cost-based savings (i.e. \code{optimal} is \code{"saving"}), then the
units should be consistent with the \code{cost_unit} parameter specified
in the \code{context}.}

\item{alloc_cost}{A vector of cost per unit of allocated surveillance
resources at each spatial location specified by \code{divisions}. Default
is \code{NULL}. Units should be consistent with the \code{cost_unit}
parameter specified in the \code{context}.}

\item{fixed_cost}{A vector of fixed costs, such as travel costs or time, at
each spatial location specified by \code{divisions}. Default is
\code{NULL}. Units should be consistent with \code{alloc_cost} when
specified. Otherwise the units should be consistent with the
\code{surv_qty_unit} parameter specified in the \code{context}.}

\item{budget}{The cost budget or constraint for the resource allocation in
the surveillance design. Default is \code{NULL}. Units should be
consistent with \code{alloc_cost} when specified. Otherwise the units
should be consistent with the \code{surv_qty_unit} parameter specified in
the \code{context}.}

\item{confidence}{The desired (minimum) system sensitivity or detection
confidence of the surveillance design (e.g. 0.95). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{min_alloc}{A vector of minimum permissible allocated surveillance
resource quantities at each spatial location specified by
\code{divisions}. Used to avoid impractically low allocation quantities.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{discrete_alloc}{A logical to indicate that the allocated surveillance
resource quantities at each division part (location, category, etc.)
specified by \code{divisions} should be discrete integers. Used to
allocate discrete surveillance units, such as traps or detectors. Default
is \code{FALSE} for continuous resources quantities, such as survey hours.}

\item{exist_alloc}{A vector of existing surveillance resource quantities at
each spatial location specified by \code{divisions}. Should only be used
to represent existing surveillance designs when \code{optimal = "none"}.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{exist_sens}{A vector, or list of vectors, of detection sensitivity
values of existing surveillance present at each spatial location specified
by \code{divisions}. Multiple existing surveillance layers may be
specified in a list. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatialSurvDesign} class object (list) containing inherited
and extended functions from the base \code{SurveillanceDesign} class for
for allocating resources, and calculating (location and overall) detection
sensitivities:
\describe{
\item{\code{get_allocation()}}{Get allocated resources via specified
strategy, utilizing costs, benefits, budget constraints, and/or
desired detection confidence level.}
\item{\code{get_sensitivity()}}{Get the location detection sensitivities
of the allocated surveillance design combined with any existing
sensitivities specified via \code{exist_sens}.}
\item{\code{get_confidence(growth = NULL)}}{Get the overall system
sensitivity or detection confidence of the allocated surveillance
design. The optional \code{growth} parameter may provide a vector of
relative increasing multipliers (e.g. 1, 1.8, 4.3, 7.5) applied to the
cell-level design \code{prevalence} over time or a sequence of
repeated surveillance efforts, which provide a proxy for invasive
species growth. When present, increasing system sensitivity values are
returned for each multiplier or time/repeat.}
\item{\code{save_design(...)}}{Save the surveillance design as a
collection of raster TIF and/or comma-separated value (CSV) files,
appropriate for the \code{divisions} type, including the surveillance
\code{allocation}, \code{sensitivity}, and a \code{summary} (CSV) of
the total allocation, total costs (when applicable), and the
detection confidence (system sensitivity). \code{Terra} raster write
options may be passed to the function for saving grid-based designs.}

\description{
Builds a class to represent surveillance design functionality for the
effective allocation of surveillance resources across spatial locations
via Lagrange-based methods for optimizing objective functions specified
with surveillance and/or incursion management costs, benefits, detection
sensitivities, and/or overall detection confidence.
